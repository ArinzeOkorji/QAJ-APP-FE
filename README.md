**Jesus is certainly the person who has the most positivly marked history.**

From ancient prophets to well-known contemporaries, philosophers; scientists; theologians; historians; artists; athletes... and many types of scholars, many have spent a great deal of their life trying to know him or to know the truth about him.

They shared the results of their investigations, in several forms, books; articles, interviews, poems, songs ... and the purpose of this application is to present these results in a simple and easily accessible form: quotes.
